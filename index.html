        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr />
        <p><img src="assets/images/profile_image_01_resized.jpg" alt="Zeke with Analog Tape Reel" class="align-left">I am an Audio Production Specialist within the Digital Collections and Curation Department at Duke Libraries. This means that I convert rare and historic analog recordings into a digital format to be archived and made available to researchers. While I also work with video, manuscripts, maps, and all kinds of other items, my passion is for sound and all of the ways it can be captured, altered, and shared. I truly believe that "obsolete" technologies have their own strengths and charms, and do not always have to be discarded when a new technology comes along.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I have also been active as a performing and recording musician in the Triangle for the past 20 years. Currently, I play various stringed and keyboard instruments in the bands Dreamless, SNAKE, and the Blood Jar Creepers. I recently contributed bass guitar to the album <cite><a href="https://productofpalmyra.elephantmicah.com/album/genericana" target="_blank">Genericana</a></cite> by Elephant Micah. I also have a solo project called <a href="http://www.northgatesyndicate.com" target= "_blank">Northgate Syndicate</a> where I bring together my interests in experimental and vernacular music from around the world.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I am currently enrolled in the UNC Coding Bootcamp. My future plans are to continue learning about web development and exploring the ways that I might be able to merge my new skills with my interests in art, music, and audio technology.</p>
